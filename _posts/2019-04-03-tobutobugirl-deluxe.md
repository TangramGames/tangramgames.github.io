## Tobu Tobu Girl Deluxe

We are thrilled to announce that we have been working on a dual GB/GBC full-color remaster of Tobu Tobu Girl, scheduled to release this summer.

Tobu Tobu Girl Deluxe is an enhanced version of the original featuring improved, full-color graphics and will be fully compatible with both the Game Boy and Game Boy Color.

Like the original, this Deluxe version will also be open source and completely free to download upon release.

## Physical release Kickstarter

The original physical run of Tobu Tobu Girl went out of stock much faster than we could've ever imagined, leaving a lot of people without the chance to get a hold of a copy. It wouldn't feel right to release this version without an accompanying physical run. To realize this we have teamed up with publisher [First Press Games](https://firstpressgames.com/) to give Tobu Tobu Girl Deluxe a high-quality physical release.

We have just launched a Kickstarter campaign where it is possible to pre-order a physical copy of Tobu Tobu Girl Deluxe.
