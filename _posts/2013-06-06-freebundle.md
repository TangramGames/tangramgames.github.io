The Free Bundle is an awesome bundle showcasing free indie games.
The newest edition features Mr. Rescue as well as four other great indie games
that you should check out.

## Version 1.02b ##
Mr. Rescue has also been updated to version 1.02b.
The update fixes a bug where the game would sometimes crash during the second and third
boss fight.

If you're playing 1.02 make sure to grab the new version.
