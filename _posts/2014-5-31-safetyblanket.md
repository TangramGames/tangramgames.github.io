We recently participated in the 29th Ludum Dare during the weekend of April 25th-28th.
The theme this time around was "under the surface".

We wanted to steer clear of the obvious ideas like mining or something under water and instead go
for something a bit quirkier. Inspired by our own childhood fears we ended up making a game in
which you drag a blanket around trying to protect the player from terrible creatures of the night.

</div>

The game was finished well withing the first 48 hours and we were pretty pleased with the result
and the amount of polish we were able to put into it.
We ended up placing first in mood, first in innovation and fifth overall which we are very
satisfied with considering it is our first time participating.
