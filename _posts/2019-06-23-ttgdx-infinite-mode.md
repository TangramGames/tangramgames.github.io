Hi everyone! We're back with a short update providing some details on the new infinite game mode we've been working on for Tobu Tobu Girl Deluxe. Once again thank you to everyone who supported the crowdfunding campaign, helping us reach this exciting stretch goal.

When designing this level, we wanted the goal to be clear and simple: getting as far as possible in a single run without dying. Unlike previous levels, the player is not scored on time or number of stumped stumped enemies - all that matters is getting far.
We decided to split the level into many small sections called "waves". This way, players have a clear sense of progress, while also getting a chance to catch their breath once in a while.

<div class="row">
{% for img in page.gifs1 %}
<div class="col-xs-6">
<a href="{{ img }}">
<img src="{{ img }}" class="img-responsive thumbnail">
</a>
</div>
{% endfor %}
</div>

In this mode, players will (for the most part) not have to collect alarm clocks to regain time. Instead, each wave has a fixed time limit. As you progress, waves will get progressively longer with more difficult obstacles, making it increasingly hard to reach the end in time.

Once in a while, the player will encounter a "special" wave. These waves have a unique twist to the rules, however, we'll leave it to you to discover what they are.

</div>
{% endfor %}
</div>

potato-tan has also been hard at work composing a new song for the level. Since this new level can potentially be played indefinitely, potato wanted the song to be longer and more varied than previous songs in the game.
The final track ended up at almost 4 minutes long, and we can't get over just how damn good it is.

In the video below you can watch some gameplay from the new level and listen to the new song action.

On the Super Game Boy, we were a bit more limited when it comes to adding colors, so we had to go with a slightly different color palette for this level. Here's what it looks like.

The game is currently in its final stage of development which means Kickstarter backers who pledged â‚¬5 or more will soon get to try out an early access version of the game. In the meantime we will be putting the final touches on the game to get it ready for release. Till next time.
