A week has now passed since we uploaded Mr. Rescue, a small game we didn't think anybody would give a damn about.
Since then the game has been downloaded almost a thousand times and we've received a lot of awesome emails, tweets and generally kind words. The whole experience has been really humbling and really amazing.

We're planning on doing a small update to the game with a couple of small fixes and improvements that should have been in the finished game, one of which being XBox 360 controller support.

We're also very eager to get started on our next game. We have already started working on a small project to fill time while we are looking for our next project. We might have something to show later this week.
