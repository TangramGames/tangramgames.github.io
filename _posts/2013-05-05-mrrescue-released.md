Today is a big day. Not only have we officially launched our new website but also
decided to release our first game Mr. Rescue.

### Mr. Rescue ###

[Mr. Rescue](http://tangramgames.dk/games/mrrescue/) is the first of hopefully many games we'll do together under
the *Tangram Games* moniker. 

The game, although simple, has been in development for several months,
and while it is not for everybody, we're still very pleased with the result.

Check out the trailer below:

### The site ###

Our new website will primarily serve as a devlog where we'll post
mockups, screenshots and gameplay videos, but might also occasionally be used for
other gamedev-related ramblings.
