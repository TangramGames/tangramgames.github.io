## About 90 Second Portraits ##

90 Second Portraits is a silly speed paint game developed for Ludum Dare 31.

Time is money and you have neither!
In 90 SECOND PORTRAITS you're paying the bills by speed painting portraits of bypassing customers!

You have 90 seconds to paint the customer and his/her prefered background!
Your work day ends after 5 customers!
