## About Sienna ##
Sienna is a simple, albeit frustrating, one-button platformer.

The game started as a solo project by Simon but features some artwork by Lukas.
Sienna was never properly finished but is still pretty fun if you like a challenge.

## How to play ##

* Press **space** to jump or wall jump when touching a wall. The longer you hold the button the higher you jump. It will often be necessary to press the button for only a splitsecond.
* Press **R** to restart from last checkpoint (counts as a death).
* Press **return** to restart from the beginning of the level.
* Oh, and the **blue orbs** are checkpoints. You're gonna need those.
* That and patience. Lots of patience.
