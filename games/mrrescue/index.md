## About Mr. Rescue ##
Mr. Rescue is a silly, fast-paced platformer about putting out fire and throwing people out the window.

The game is currently in development, and will be released for free for Windows, Linux and OS X sometime early 2013.

## Downloads ##

Mr. Rescue is far from done but we might upload beta versions here when we get closer to release.

If you're comfortable with the [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org/) framework feel free to download the latest development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/SimonLarsen/mrrescue) at your own risk.
